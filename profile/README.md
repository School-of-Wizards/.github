This organization bundles all repositories associated with **WizardDeck**, our proposed all-in-one solution for Skat and Doppelkopf.

**WizardDeck** is made up of multiple sub-projects:
- GameTracker = app with a database system, able to track players and their results
- Shuffler = machine that can scan, shuffle and deal cards automagically
- GameChecker = software system able to check the validity of played games for rule violation
- GameGen = module to generate valid gameplays to test the other subsystems
